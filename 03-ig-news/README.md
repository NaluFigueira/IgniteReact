## :pencil: Notes

<img src="./NextJS.png" alt="Diference between SPA and SSR when using Next.js">

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Advantages of using Next.js</strong>
    <p>
      The main advantage of using Next.js is SEO that enables the browsers to collect information about Reacts components without having Javascript enabled. Also, Next.js has built-in SASS
      support and file-system routing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Creating Next.js app</strong>
    
      yarn create next-app ignews

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>_app.tsx</strong>
    <p>The auto created component MyApp is a component that will always be around every component in the application. It works similarly to the route provider in the React Router Dom library.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>document.tsx</strong>
    <p>This component will be rendered only once, at the start of the application. It works similarly to the index.html in the public folder of a create-react-app project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Images in Next.js</strong>
    <p>Images in Next.js projects should be in an images folder inside public folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>API in Next.js</strong>
    <p>For more important API calls, specially the ones that contains important information for search engines, it's recommended to call the API in Next.js SSR. To do that, you need to add in your component a getServerSideProps function. That function will return to the component the api call info.</p>
