### Declarative UI

Originated with Theme UI, declarative UI is a promising tool regarding styling components in an application.

The main difference between usual styling and declarative styling is that in declarative styling we can define a component style in its own JSX tag. To avoid making the code "dirty" with inline styles, the frameworks provide a lot of default components and encourages the development of small, modular and reusable components, which also improves the code maintainability.

Other popular declarative UI frameworks for React: Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS.
